# Reinforcement Learning

It is a type of Machine learning used in Artificial Intelligence to train an AI. It consists of Five Steps:

## Principle 1:
Input/ Output System

## Principle 2:
Reward System to train the AI with good or bad reward.

## Principle 3:
AI Environment: Space where Input/Output System and reward are integrated to work on a goal.

## Principle 4:
Markov Decision Process: It aim to integrate Ai Environment with desired goal and make sure to maximize the reward for AI 

## Principle 5:
Training: Deal with chosing a model, deciding parameters, taking action and giving reward based on actions, chosing different parameters, techniques to maximize the reward, and repeat again until achieved desired goal.             
Inference: It takes place after th training and is associated with action required to complete the desired goal.
